# Week-07

# Overview

The task involves collecting data from a subreddit using the Reddit API and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).

  The collected data is stored in a SQLite3 database.

  Basic EDA includes creating at least two visualizations.

  A short analysis is required at the end to summarize findings.

# Key Tasks

1.Reddit API Setup

  Requires creating a Reddit account and API keys.

  Uses the praw library for data extraction.

  The notebook imports necessary libraries like pandas, matplotlib, wordcloud, and textblob.

2.Data Collection

  The subreddit "Samsung" is used as an example.

  Extracts hot posts from the subreddit, with a limit of 10.

  Prints post titles and scores.

3.Data Processing and Storage

  Saves the extracted posts in a structured format.

  Uses SQLite3 for database storage.

4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  Expected to include two plots (not extracted in this summary but likely visualizations of post engagement).
